* String

## Responsibilities

* Geometric data structures and operations over them, including 2D and 3D primitives

## Remarks
* Should be templated to allow different data types to be used with them
* Classes should have non-member transformation functions? (case for: decoupling, case against: non standard)

## Public interface

* Point2D / 3D (Naming? G2D::Point, G3D::Point or Point2D, Point3D, or Point, G3D::Point or Point, Point3D)
* Rectangle (3D not needed?)
* Bounds2D / 3D
* Margins (no need for 3D)
* Line2D / 3D
* Polygon2D / 3D
* Triangle2D / 3D
