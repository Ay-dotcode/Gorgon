    /**
     * This class simplifies the use of repeated keystrokes when a key is pressed. It can
     * work automatically with a KeyEvent or manually when its functions is called. Every
     * time a key repeats the associated event will be fired with the key. If a key is
     * repeated multiple times in a single frame, the Repeat event will be fired that many
     * times one after another. Initial delay, repeat interval, and repeat acceleration can
     * be modified to customize behavior of the repeater. 
     * 
     * KeyRepeater can repeat multiple keys. Multiple Repeat events can be fired in a single
     * frame. The order of repeat events between keys is not defined. However, if the same key 
     * is repeated multiple times in the same frame, these repeats are always sequential.
     * KeyRepeater has no notion of inverse keys (eg. left and right). The best course of action
     * is to apply the effect of these keys separately.
     * 
     * KeyRepeater is not suitable for most games. It is designed mainly as a text editing tool.
     * 
     * KeyRepeater can also be used with mouse keys. However, as of now, mouse keys should 
     * be pressed and released manually.
     * 
     * KeyRepeater is also an animation, it is bound with a timer, and effected by the
     * active animation governor.
