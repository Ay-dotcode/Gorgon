    /**
     * @page "Drag & Drop"
     * Drag and drop facilities in Gorgon Library has two starting points: within the system,
     * and from the operating system. Both systems can be handled the same way. To receive
     * drop and drag related events, a DropTarget should be created. This is a layer that works
     * very similarly to a regular input layer. However, it will not invoke any actions unless
     * an object is being dragged. If the event is starting within the system, a drag source can
	 * be created to capture events about the drag operation. This allows source to receive events
	 * without any connection to the target. 
	 * 
     * While drag continues, source event will keep receiving move event. Targeted mouse event
     * will receive over event if hit test succeeds. If it accepts over event, target layer 
	 * will receive move and drop events. If mouse exits the current target area, out event will
     * fire. This will be fired even if over event returns false, allowing the destination
	 * to change and restore pointer shape. If target event handler accepts drop event, source 
	 * will receive accept event. If it is not accepted or there is no target that accepts the 
	 * data, source will receive cancel event. Any object is allowed to cancel drag operation.
	 * During move event, destination can return false to denote that the dragged object can
	 * no longer be dropped over it and out event of the source is called. If destination returns 
	 * false to drop event, drag operation will be canceled. If an operation is canceled and if
	 * the object is over a layer, out event is called before cancel event.
	 *
	 * During drag operation, only layers derived from DropTarget will receive over events. This
	 * will prevent any layers changing the mouse cursor during the drag operation. For full drag
	 * with symbol and cursor, source should set the cursor to drag, and keep symbol drawn on a
	 * high level layer on move event. Targets should change the cursor whether they can accept
	 * the drop. Targets will receive out event even if they reject over, allowing them to set
	 * back cursor to original.
	 *
	 * It is possible to perform drag operation without holding the mouse button. Start the drag
	 * operation after a click or a mouse up. It will work without any problems. Droping requires
	 * clicking in this case. The target will not receive a click event if drag is dropped this
	 * way.
