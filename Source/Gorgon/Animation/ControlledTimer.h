	 * controlled animation will be controlled separately. Thus
	 * when the progress is set to 1, all animations will progress
	 * to end. 
     * 
     * This is a meta controller if there are multiple
     * animations using it. Unless designed to work together, meta
     * controllers and meta animations should not be used together.
