	/// Millisecond based timer. This class allows performance calculations.
	/// Constructing a new timer effectively starts it. However, explicit start
	/// might be used to exclude the time passed from the Timer construction or
	/// last Tick. All output functions are constant and do not modify the timer.
	/// Because of this, a Tick method might be necessary. The display functions
	/// will always report the time passed at the last tick. Pause function is not
	/// required and not included. Pause can be performed by issuing a Tick and
	/// using Start at the end of the pause. This class has a very low memory and 
	/// processing overhead.
	/// 
	/// *Example:*
	/// @code
	///     // Counts the time passed in longoperation functions
	///     Timer timer;
	///     longoperation();
	///     std::cout<<timer.Tick()<<std::endl;
	///     anotheroperation();
	///     timer.Start();
	///     longoperation();
	///     timer.Tick().ShowDialog(); //Tick function can be cascaded
	/// @endcode
