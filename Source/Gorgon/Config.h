 * library. When compiling Gorgon, the default values can be set by compiler definitions
 * which also contains namespaces separated by underscore. Namespace and variable names
 * should all be capitalized. For instance, if you want to modify ClickThreshold in
 * WindowManager namespace, you should define GORGON_WINDOWMANAGER_CLICKTHRESHOLD.
